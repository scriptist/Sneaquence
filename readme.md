# Sneaquence

Sneaquence is a lighting sequencer designed to help sequence Christmas lights to music. It saves to MongoDB and can output JSON files, which can be read by a Raspberry Pi connected to a series of relays to play both the audio and the lighting sequence simultaneously.

Work has not yet begun on the Raspberry Pi app.
